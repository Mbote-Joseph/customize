# Customize

A painless tool to create HTML email signatures â€” without coding another table. Built with React.  

_**P.S.** So this can be used as a teaching tool, I tried to make the markup and CSS stupidly simple while also not ejecting it from [`create-react-app`.](https://www.github.com/facebook/create-react-app)_
